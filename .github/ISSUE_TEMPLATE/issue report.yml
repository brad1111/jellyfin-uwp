        ### General preliminary information

        Please keep the following in mind when creating this issue:

        1. Fill in as much of the template as possible. When you are unsure about the relevancy of a section, do include the information requested in that section. Only leave out information in sections when you are completely sure about it not being relevant.
        2. Provide as much detail as possible. Do not assume other people to know what is going on.
        3. Keep everything readable and structured. Nobody enjoys reading poorly written reports that are difficult to understand.
        4. Keep an eye on your report as long as it is open, your involvement might be requested at a later moment.
        5. Keep the title short and descriptive. The title is not the place to write down a full description of the issue.
        6. When deciding to leave out information in a field, leave it blank and empty. Avoid writing things such as `n/a` for empty fields.
